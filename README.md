# Ovation

## Project Status

Development has significantly slowed as we are working toward on other projects post-bootcamp graduation. Our hopes are to continue to refine both functionality and styling to improve the site. 

## Description

Ovation is a site for finding events/concerts in your area. Browse events by artist, viewing past live concert events by that particular artist. 

This is the front end only, as the back end (www.github.com/antrubbo/ovation_backend) was created in a separate repository for possible deployment using Heroku. 

Event data is supplied by songkick (www.songkick.com/developer).

## Contributers

Ovation was built by Anthony Rubbo (https://github.com/antrubbo) and Ekene Nkem-Mmekam (https://github.com/Ekenayy) during their time in Flatiron School's SE intensive program.
