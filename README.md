# Ovation

## Description

Ovation is a site for finding events/concerts in your area.   A few notable user stories include that a user can:

* Browse events by artist 
* Edit their account details
* View past live concert events by that particular artist
* "Buy" tickets for that concert
* See all of their upcoming concerts

The event data, provided by songkick, is real and accurate. 

This is the front end only. [The back end](www.github.com/antrubbo/ovation_backend) was created as a separate repository for ease of deployment.

## Project Status

Development has slowed significantly as we are working on a few other projects. Our hopes are to continue to refine both functionality and styling to improve the site. We built this project in a little under a week so there are a lot of cool features that we didn't get to implement. A few of our long-term goals include: 
* Integrating the Youtube API to provide videos based on user input
* Adding modals for Youtube videos
* Re-designing the home page 
* Integrating a payment API
* Moving Songkick API logic from Seed file to controllers for fresh,live data
* Providing event recommendations based on user preferences
